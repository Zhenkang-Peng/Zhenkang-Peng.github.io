Hi, I am Zhenkang Peng. I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong) advised by [Prof. Renyu(Philip) Zhang](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/zhang-philip-renyu/) . I received my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering at the [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Jiao_Tong_University) in 2024, advised by [Prof. Ying Rong](https://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/rongying.html#container). I earned my Bachelorâ€™s in Information Management and Information System from [Dalian Univeisity of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalian_University_of_Technology) in 2019.

My research focuses on data-driven decision-making for both offline and online learning under uncertainty. I aim to develop methodologies and practical solutions by integrating tools and concepts from optimization, machine learning, and statistics. Additionally, I completed a one-year internship at [Meituan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meituan), where I actively contributed to designing and enhancing their ordering algorithm.
