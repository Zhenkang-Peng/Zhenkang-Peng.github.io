Hi, I am Zhenkang Peng.  I received my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2024, advised by [Prof. Ying Rong](https://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/rongying.html#container). I earned my Bachelorâ€™s in Information Management and Information System from Dalian Univeisity of Technology in 2019.

My research focuses on data-driven decision-making for both offline and online learning under uncertainty. I aim to develop methodologies and practical solutions by integrating tools and concepts from optimization, machine learning, and statistics. Additionally, I completed a one-year internship at Meituan, where I actively contributed to designing and enhancing their ordering algorithm.
